            <p>
                PreForm is a Desktop Application that allows users to prepare 3D models for printing on Formlabs
                printers. The application is used by engineers, designers, and other professionals to create
                high-quality prints.
                The goal of the project was to create a new UI framework that would make the application more
                user-friendly and intuitive.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-top: var(--spacing-medium)"><strong>Objective: </strong> Create a modular framework and
                UI/UX elements, for a simpler and
                powerful user-experience to streamline workflows.

            <h2>Innovating 3D Printing and Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                Developed a <strong>patent-pending</strong> algorithm for 3D printing support generation, a critical
                feature in PreForm
                that automatically generates support structures for 3D models. The algorithm reduces the material-usage
                by
                35% by automatically generating supports that are optimized for the model and the printer. This feature
                improves print quality, reduces print time, and minimizes material usage.

            <p>
                Led the end-to-end development of high-performance feature called <strong>part cages</strong>, a feature
                in PreForm, are used to efficiently pack and organize multiple small parts within a
                single 3D print. They create a structured enclosure around the parts, ensuring they remain in place
                during the printing process, particularly in SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) printing. This method
                minimizes the risk of part movement or damage, improves print reliability, and makes post-processing
                easier by keeping parts contained in a defined space.
