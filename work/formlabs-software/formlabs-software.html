        <p> As a Lead UI Developer, I was responsible for the development of a next-gen UI framework for a Desktop
            Application. I worked closely with the design team to create a user-friendly interface that was both
            intuitive and visually appealing.

            <h2>Developing Next Generation UI</h2>
            <p>
                PreForm is a Desktop Application that allows users to prepare 3D models for printing on Formlabs
                printers. The application is used by engineers, designers, and other professionals to create
                high-quality prints.
                The goal of the project was to create a new UI framework that would make the application more
                user-friendly and intuitive.

            <h2>Toolbar Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Before:</strong>
                Problems with the toolbar were identified through user testing and feedback. The toolbar was
                cluttered and had too many options.
                The icons were not intuitive and the user had to hover over each icon to see what it did.
                In addition, it's taking up too much space on the screen.

            <p>
                <strong>After:</strong>
                The toolbar was redesigned to be more intuitive and user-friendly. The icons were updated to be more
                recognizable and the button text was added.
                We also made the toolbar floating, to allow for more screen space. It also has extensive tooltips to
                help users understand the functionality of each button.

            <h2>Print Upload Workflow Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Before:</strong>
                The print upload workflow was not user-friendly. Users had to navigate through multiple screens to
                upload a print.
                It also included some copying of logic, to have errors and printer-info in print-dialog.
            </p>
            <img src="./work/formlabs-software/before-print.png" alt="Before-Print" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
                <strong>After:</strong>
                Complexity was reduced by combining the print upload workflow into a single modal. The user can now
                upload a print in a single step.
                Print Dialog was removed and the user can now see the printer-info and errors in the other relevant
                parts of the application.
