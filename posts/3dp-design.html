            <p> In this research, we collected eye-tracking data from nine engineering graduate students as they
                redesigned a traditionally manufactured part for Additive Manufacturing. Final artifacts were assessed
                for manufacturability and quality of final design, and design behaviors were captured via the
                eye-tracking data. Statistical analysis of design behavior duration shows that participants with more
                than three years of industry experience spend significantly less time removing material and revising
                than those with less experience. Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) analysis of the design behaviors gives
                insight to the transitions between behaviors through which designers proceed. Findings show that high
                performing designers proceeded through four behavioral states, smoothly transitioning between states. In
                contrast, low-performing designers roughly transitioned between states, with moderate transition
                probabilities back and forth between multiple states.​

                <h2>Results</h2>

                <p> Results show that high-performing designers spend much more time in indirect design activities, such
                    as stress analysis, than the low-performing designers, who tend to focus on removing material. The
                    design behavior heuristics were characterized from aggregated and disaggregated HMMs. Although the
                    transmission patterns differ between the aggregate and performance-disaggregated models, each model
                    does typically suggest that two states deal with direct design tasks such as sketching, editing, or
                    removing material, and two that pertain to indirect design tasks such as project scoping. The
                    transmission matrices show that designers proceed through an iterative design process, aligning with
                    most previous design literature. However, the calculated transition probabilities show that
                    low-performing designers have more and higher transition probabilities than high-performing
                    designers, indicating a more rapid transition between activities. This finding indicates that
                    perhaps high-performing designers may be better at self-regulation during the design process,
                    staying focused on a given task, whereas low-performing designers tend not to focus on the same
                    behaviors within the hidden states as well as the high-performing designers.. </p>

                <h2>Details</h2>
                <p>Delta-Design is a fictional design game developed by Bucciarelli, to teach students the social
                    designing skills such as communications, trade-offs, and team-dynamics. This game consists of a
                    well-defined configuration design problem, but on a skewed physics system. Due to this anomaly
                    in
                    world, this makes it challenging for designers to apply existing domain knowledge and design
                    heuristics. However, the objectives in the design problem are identical to typical configuration
                    design problems, therefore, making it a research tool suitable for studying designing for
                    structurally similar novel problem.</p>

                     class="img-fluid">
                <p>To facilitate design and data collection, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using
                    MATLAB’s App designer. Besides facilitating the virtual design, we also focused on providing a
                    more
                    authentic design environment by embedding client feedback as a feature in the tool. The back end
                    of
                    the GUI tests the design score and satisfaction of constraints in real-time. The GUI also does
                    not
                    allow for impossible design features (for example, overlapping delta triangles). There are nine
                    design actions that can be performed to complete the challenge. We place these actions on three
                    different panels based on their roles. There are three message boxes in GUI: Delta World Status,
                    Design Feedback, and Participant Information. The “Delta Status” message box displays the
                    success or
                    an error message corresponding to a designer’s actions. The “Participant Information” box
                    displays
                    the participant number, time left for the study and number of deltas. The “Design Score” message
                    box
                    is an essential feature for making this GUI a real-life experience, providing real-time insight
                    as
                    to the constraints when designs do not meet requirements. We also designed a control panel to
                    provide a way to mitigate accidental mistakes. For example, if a designer accidentally deletes a
                    triangle, they can use the UNDO function to return to the previous state. We added a panel at
                    bottom
                    for an overview of design constraints and objective function details. More information about the
                    software can be found here.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>We characterize patterns of design behaviors enacted by designers using Hidden Markov Models to
                    investigate high- and low-performing designers (as classified using their design performance),
                    and
                    efficient- and inefficient designers (as classified using number of actions they took).</p>

                     class="img-fluid">
                <p> HMM captured variances and similarities in the patterns of behaviors and the way that different
                    groups of designers proceeded through latent states. This data were analyzed statistically in
                    aggregate and then by training four Hidden Markov Models to depict the underlying latent
                    “states” of
                    behaviors in which the designers engaged. The participants for this study were
                    intermediate-level
                    designers currently enrolled in graduate engineering programs. Our findings indicated that both
                    efficient and inefficient designers could achieve high-performing client scores, but the
                    underlying
                    patterns of behaviors between the groups were dissimilar. Interpreted through Schraagen’s design
                    theory, we observed:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>The high-performing and efficient designers indicated more methodical Progressive Deepening
                        strategies as they systematically divided the task into small subtasks, approaching the
                        structural components first and then optimizing the parametric components of the design
                        later..
                    </li>
                    <li>The inefficient designers took a more trial-and-error approach throughout the process,
                        resulting
                        in rougher state transitions via the HMM.
                    </li>
                    <li>Results from this study show how intermediate level designers may still be developing
                        learning
                        strategies to apply which solving a novel design problem and illuminate how design theory
                        manifests in a population group that is neither novice nor expert.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Further, this study is the first to demonstrate a digital version of the classic Delta Design
                    challenge for an individual, which we posit can be used to continue to investigate the
                    problem-solving strategies inherent in engineering design thinking.</p>
