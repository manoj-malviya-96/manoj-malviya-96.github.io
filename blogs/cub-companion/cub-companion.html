        <p>Each year, more than 40k children undergo cancer treatments ﻿("Childhood Cancer Statistics | research,”
            2019). These treatments and the associated “new normal” cause stress for the patients. The effect of
            this stress can cause negative long- and short-term physical and psychological consequences, such as
            longer hospital stays and refusal to seek medical treatment. To prevent these consequences, it is vital
            to ease as much stress as possible during pediatric cancer treatments. Preliminary research has
            suggested that education, distraction techniques, and breathing exercises may be beneficial to children
            during these procedures.To test the best method for easing stress and anxiety during cancer treatments,
            the Cub Companion team interviewed two pediatric nurses and six parents of children with childhood
            cancer diagnoses. Using the information gathered, we conducted a qualitative content analysis using
            pre-coded themes to determine prevalent ideas throughout the interviews. Themes emerged of trust with
            parents and medical staff, comfort in a new environment, and distraction during invasive procedures.
            These results aided the team in creating an updated Cub Companion concept. They may scan a customizable
            physical bear into a virtual world in a mobile application. In this virtual world, the child’s bear may
            interact with representations of their real-life nurses and play games to build trust and provide a
            distraction. We tested this concept with a low-fidelity paper prototype, and with feedback, a
            medium-fidelity Adobe XD prototype was created. After preliminary user testing, the virtual world shows
            promise for being capable of providing distraction and helping the child build trust with medical
            personnel.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> The Cub Companion project addresses the stress experienced by children undergoing cancer treatments.
                Pediatric cancer treatments can cause significant psychological and physical stress, which may lead
                to longer hospital stays and avoidance of future medical treatments. The project aims to alleviate
                this stress using educational tools, distraction techniques, and trust-building exercises between
                children, their parents, and medical personnel.</p>

            <h2>Details</h2>
            <p>The Cub Companion combines a customizable physical teddy bear with a mobile application that scans
                the bear into a virtual world. In this virtual environment, the bear interacts with virtual
                representations of the child’s real-life nurses, aiming to build trust and provide distraction
                during medical procedures. The concept was tested through user interviews and prototypes, focusing
                on creating a supportive environment for children.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Testing revealed that the interactive features of the Cub Companion could effectively distract
                children and foster trust with medical staff. The prototypes received positive feedback,
                highlighting the potential for the virtual world to reduce stress during treatments. However, there
                was a noted need for further testing to optimize game interactions and nurse engagement within the
                app to maximize its effectiveness.</p>
