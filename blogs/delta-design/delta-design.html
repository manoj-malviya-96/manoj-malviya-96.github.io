            <p>This paper presents design findings from a study employing a digital version of the Delta
                Design
                Game
                tool, originally developed by Bucciarelli in 1991. In this work, we present a digital interface in
                which
                users play the Delta Design game online while the interface collects data on the behavior of the
                designer. Using our tool, players can compose, revise and verify the designs on a digital platform,
                while the digital tool captures every action taken in the interface. For this research, we studied
                N=15
                engineering graduate students to compare design behaviors in groups of high-performing and
                low-performing designers. We used Hidden Markov Modeling techniques to discern patterns of behaviors
                between high-performing designers and low-performing designers. Our findings from the Hidden Markov
                Models show that designers proceed through four procedural latent states for the design challenge.
                High-performing designers typically achieve optimal performance by dividing the complex novel
                problems
                into sub-problems and defining an analogy with familiar tasks. Both efficient and inefficient
                designers
                are able to achieve high-performing scores but show different cognitive processes. Interpreted
                through
                Schraagen’s theory of design cognition, the high performing designers in general showed progressive
                deepening strategies, progressing systematically through subtasks, starting with structural aspects
                of
                the challenge before the parametric optimization.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>Because engineering design requires significant  iterative  cognitive activities and the synthesis of
                    domain-specific knowledge, researchers are often interested in the transfer of strategies for
                    domain-specific knowledge. There are three classifications of strategies that are typically studied:
                    Control strategies, Heuristic strategies, and Learning strategies. Control strategies determine
                    which
                    tasks should be carried out, heuristic strategies determine how a task should be carried out, and
                    learning strategies are the ways that designers learn to carry out tasks. These transfer learning
                    attributes vary between expert designers and novices and therefore affects the solution quality of
                    novel
                    problems.</p>
                <p>Researchers have explored the behaviors of experts and novices while solving novel problems. Results
                    of
                    these studies suggests that the experts use general control and heuristic strategies that they
                    learned
                    previously while working in a specific domain. Besides using task-specific strategies, experts also
                    implement their abstract and organized domain knowledge. Schraagen showed that experts tend to solve
                    novel problems by dividing subproblems in a specific order and then applying abstract knowledge
                    structures and heuristic strategies to compensate for their lack of domain knowledge. Schraagen
                    presented two global characteristic strategies for the way experts tackling novel problems: The
                    first is
                    called progressive deepening and the second is called mental simulation. **Progressive deepening**
                    is a
                    control strategy, where the designer proceeds through the same sub-problem repeatedly, with each
                    pass
                    gaining new information, and establishing automaticity in their design responses. **Mental
                    simulation**,
                    on the other hand, is a heuristic strategy where design experts mentally establish the outcome of a
                    design action before taking action. We build on the previous work and explore the novel problem
                    solving
                    process of graduate students for a potential impact on design education research and computational
                    design, where these learned strategies can benefit engineering graduate students and the development
                    of
                    generative artificial intelligence. </p>

                <p> In this work, we present a digital interface of the Delta Design Game to facilitate our
                    investigation of
                    novel design problems. Participants play the Delta Design game interactively, while the interface
                    collects all moves representing design decisions throughout the duration of the game. Players can
                    compose, revise, and analyze their design using this tool on an online platform while our interface
                    capture every state of design and thus, providing a rich source to analyze the enacted design
                    behaviors.
                    We employ this design platform to compare the design behaviors between high-performing and
                    low-performing designers in a novel problem design context. We also compared the design behaviors
                    between efficient and inefficient designers, to study the effect of automaticity. To this end, the
                    overarching question this research seeks to answer is as follows:</p>

                <blockquote>What design strategies do intermediate-level designers employ when challenged with a novel
                    complex problem?

                <h2>Details</h2>

                <p>Delta-Design is a fictional design game developed by Bucciarelli, to teach students the social
                    designing skills such as communications, trade-offs, and team-dynamics. This game consists of a
                    well-defined configuration design problem, but on a skewed physics system. Due to this anomaly
                    in
                    world, this makes it challenging for designers to apply existing domain knowledge and design
                    heuristics. However, the objectives in the design problem are identical to typical configuration
                    design problems, therefore, making it a research tool suitable for studying designing for
                    structurally similar novel problem.</p>

                     class="img-fluid">
                <p>To facilitate design and data collection, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using
                    MATLAB’s App designer. Besides facilitating the virtual design, we also focused on providing a
                    more
                    authentic design environment by embedding client feedback as a feature in the tool. The back end
                    of
                    the GUI tests the design score and satisfaction of constraints in real-time. The GUI also does
                    not
                    allow for impossible design features (for example, overlapping delta triangles). There are nine
                    design actions that can be performed to complete the challenge. We place these actions on three
                    different panels based on their roles. There are three message boxes in GUI: Delta World Status,
                    Design Feedback, and Participant Information. The “Delta Status” message box displays the
                    success or
                    an error message corresponding to a designer’s actions. The “Participant Information” box
                    displays
                    the participant number, time left for the study and number of deltas. The “Design Score” message
                    box
                    is an essential feature for making this GUI a real-life experience, providing real-time insight
                    as
                    to the constraints when designs do not meet requirements. We also designed a control panel to
                    provide a way to mitigate accidental mistakes. For example, if a designer accidentally deletes a
                    triangle, they can use the UNDO function to return to the previous state. We added a panel at
                    bottom
                    for an overview of design constraints and objective function details. More information about the
                    software can be found here.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>We characterize patterns of design behaviors enacted by designers using Hidden Markov Models to
                    investigate high- and low-performing designers (as classified using their design performance),
                    and
                    efficient- and inefficient designers (as classified using number of actions they took).</p>

                <div id="heatmap1" class="plot" style="margin: var(--spacing-large) auto"></div>

                <p> HMM captured variances and similarities in the patterns of behaviors and the way that different
                    groups of designers proceeded through latent states. This data were analyzed statistically in
                    aggregate and then by training four Hidden Markov Models to depict the underlying latent
                    “states” of
                    behaviors in which the designers engaged. The participants for this study were
                    intermediate-level
                    designers currently enrolled in graduate engineering programs. Our findings indicated that both
                    efficient and inefficient designers could achieve high-performing client scores, but the
                    underlying
                    patterns of behaviors between the groups were dissimilar. </p>

                <p> Interpreted through Schraagen’s design
                    theory, we observed:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>The high-performing and efficient designers indicated more methodical Progressive Deepening
                        strategies as they systematically divided the task into small subtasks, approaching the
                        structural components first and then optimizing the parametric components of the design
                        later..
                    </li>
                    <li>The inefficient designers took a more trial-and-error approach throughout the process,
                        resulting
                        in rougher state transitions via the HMM.
                    </li>
                    <li>Results from this study show how intermediate level designers may still be developing
                        learning
                        strategies to apply which solving a novel design problem and illuminate how design theory
                        manifests in a population group that is neither novice nor expert.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Further, this study is the first to demonstrate a digital version of the classic Delta Design
                    challenge for an individual, which we posit can be used to continue to investigate the
                    problem-solving strategies inherent in engineering design thinking.</p>
