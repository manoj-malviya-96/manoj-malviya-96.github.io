        <!-- abstract -->
        <p> This project dives into how engineering students approach design challenges in a digital game that tracks
            every step. Analyzing behaviors from 15 participants, the study reveals that high-performing designers tend
            to break down complex problems into manageable sub-problems and relate them to familiar concepts. Both
            efficient and less efficient strategies can lead to high scores, but the top performers use a progressive
            deepening approach—starting with foundational structure before moving into detailed optimization.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> In engineering design, problem-solving blends strategy and knowledge transfer, especially across three
                key approaches: control, heuristic, and learning. Research shows experts often lean on general control
                and heuristic strategies they’ve honed in their field, plus organized, abstract knowledge to tackle new
                problems. Schraagen describes two main strategies: progressive deepening—repeating sub-problems to build
                automatic responses—and mental simulation, where experts mentally predict outcomes before acting.
                Building on this, we study how graduate students solve novel problems to inform design education and
                computational design, aiming to support both engineering students and AI development.</p>

            <p> This work introduces a digital Delta Design Game to study how designers tackle novel problems. The tool
                records each decision, allowing us to analyze behaviors of high vs. low performers and efficient vs.
                inefficient designers, focusing on how automaticity affects design outcomes. To this end, the
                overarching question this research seeks to answer is as follows:</p>

            <div class="img-label">What design strategies do intermediate-level designers employ when challenged with a
                novel
                complex problem?

            <h2>Details</h2>

            <p> Delta-Design, created by Bucciarelli, is a fictional game crafted to teach students essential social
                design skills like communication, trade-offs, and team dynamics. The game presents a unique challenge by
                placing a typical configuration design problem in a world with altered physics, making it tough to apply
                familiar knowledge and strategies. Despite this twist, its objectives mirror real-world design tasks,
                making Delta-Design an ideal tool for studying how designers approach structurally similar but novel
                problems.</p>

            </div>
            <p>To support design and data collection, we built a MATLAB-based GUI that mimics a real-world design
                environment by incorporating client feedback and real-time constraint checks. The interface guides users
                with error and success messages and blocks impossible actions, like overlapping triangles. It includes
                three message boxes for feedback on Delta World Status, design details, and participant info, plus a
                control panel for actions like UNDO to correct mistakes. Finally, a summary panel at the bottom displays
                design constraints and objectives, enhancing user experience and accuracy.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>We characterize patterns of design behaviors enacted by designers using Hidden Markov Models to
                investigate high- and low-performing designers (as classified using their design performance),
                and
                efficient- and inefficient designers (as classified using number of actions they took).</p>

            <div id="heatmap1" class="plot" style="margin: var(--spacing-large) auto"></div>

            <p> In this study, HMM highlighted variances and similarities in how different designer groups moved through
                latent states. The data was analyzed both in aggregate and through four distinct HMMs that modeled the
                core latent behavior “states” designers engaged in. Participants were intermediate-level designers from
                graduate engineering programs. Findings showed that while both efficient and inefficient designers could
                score well, their behavior patterns differed significantly. </p>

            <div id="heatmap2" class="plot" style="margin: var(--spacing-large) auto"></div>

            <p>Interpreted through Schraagen’s design theory, we observed:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The high-performing and efficient designers used more methodical Progressive Deepening strategies by
                    systematically dividing the task into small subtasks, first focusing on structural components and
                    then optimizing parametric components.
                </li>
                <li>The inefficient designers took a more trial-and-error approach, resulting in rougher state
                    transitions via the HMM.
                </li>
                <li>Results show that intermediate designers may still be developing strategies for novel problems,
                    highlighting how design theory appears in a group that is neither novice nor expert.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Further, this study is the first to demonstrate a digital version of the classic Delta Design
                challenge for an individual, which we posit can be used to continue to investigate the
                problem-solving strategies inherent in engineering design thinking.</p>
