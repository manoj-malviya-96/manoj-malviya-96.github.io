        <!-- abstract -->
        <p>Additive manufacturing (AM) offers designers access to the entire volume of an artifact during its build
            operation, including the embedding of foreign objects, like sensors, motors, and actuators, into the
            artifact to produce multifunctional products from the build tray. However, the application of embedding
            requires extensive designer expertise in AM. This research aims to develop a tool to automate design
            decisions for in-situ embedding, eliminating the need for ad-hoc design decisions made by experts. Two
            unique approaches are proposed in this work: Shadow Projection and Voxel Simulation. Both of these
            approaches follow a three-stage methodology to achieve design automation by 1) identifying the optimum
            orientation for the object, 2) designing cavity, and finally 3) designing the shape converter for a
            flush surface at the paused layer. The two approaches differ in stages 2 and 3. Where the shadow
            projection approach employs a series of point cloud manipulation to geometry of the embedded object, the
            Voxel simulation approach simulates the process of insertion of the embedding geometry into the part
            voxel by voxel. While both proposed approaches are successful in automating design for embedding complex
            geometries, they result in tradeoffs between final designs and the time for computation. Computational
            experiment with six test cases show that designers must strategically choose from one of the approaches
            to efficiently automate the digital design for embedding.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Additive Manufacturing’s (AM) ability to build products with both extensive geometric and material
                complexity, is having a significant impact on the fields of design and manufacturing. User-defined
                control of material deposition affords unique design opportunities, including in-situ embedding of
                functional objects to create consolidated multifunctional parts. The ability to interrupt the
                manufacturing process to embed a foreign object into a part allows designers to integrate reliable
                functional objects within printed structures. This enables the creation of “smart parts” with
                integrated circuits and sensors directly from the build tray. However, it is not as straight forward
                as it looks. For instance, a spherical object can be imbedded in to cube with a circular cavity. We
                require a proper cavity and a flush surface for resuming layered printing and protect the embedding
                object as shown in figure. In this work, we design an additional part called shape convertor to
                provide flush surface. Concluding, automating the design process requires the production of the
                cavity, shape convertor, and the orientation of embedding object.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>

            <p>The objective of this research is to automate design for embedding with AM for any arbitrary object
                geometry through a computational tool. To identify the framework for this tool, the design process
                was broken into three stages: 1) embedding orientation selection, 2) automation of cavity design,
                and 3) automation of shape converter design. Two approaches are presented for stage 2 and 3: Shadow
                Projection and the Voxel Simulation ​.</p>
            <img src="./blogs/embed-am/algo.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <h3>Stage 1: Orientation Optimization</h3>
            <p> With the understanding of material strength and orientation generated from previous research, an
                embedded component should ideally be oriented so that cross-sectional area of the cavity is
                minimized at the embedding plane. Through this consideration, the tensile strength of the part is
                maximized if loaded perpendicular to the embedding plane. As such, the first stage of the proposed
                process focuses on obtaining this ideal orientation for any arbitrary component geometry. To
                calculate the area, we developed a computational method called shadow projection.
                A shadow projection technique is used to ensure that the cavity is large enough to completely insert
                the part in a selected orientation. The shadow projection method can be visualized as a shadow on a
                flat surface by the geometry when parallel light rays are vertically cast over it (see figure
                below). Here, the X-Y coordinates of the vertices on the planes perpendicular to the object’s
                orientation vector are projected on to the X-Y plane at the top-most plane of that orientation,
                resulting in a point cloud on the X-Y plane. A 2-dimensional shape that bounds the resulting point
                cloud is obtained as the cross-section of the cavity at the paused layer using 2D quick-hull
                algorithm, for this orientation. The shadow curve obtained contains all the projected points to
                paused layer and thus, this cross section will allow the object would successfully be inserted.</p>
            <img src="./blogs/embed-am/cavity_geom.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <p> To obtain an ideal orientation, optimization is performed for the cavity for minimizing cross
                section area at paused layer over design variable orientation , which is determined by obtaining the
                area of the closed shadow curve obtained and is denoted as As. However, for any geometry, at least
                two flipped orientations will have the same shadow curve (see above figure), such that there will be
                multiple orientations with minimum . While these two flipped orientations need the same
                cross-section area of the cavity for successful insertion, the cavity volume may differ. To address
                the problem of multiple viable solutions, another objective function is introduced to minimize the
                cavity volume. Cavity design is obtained by taking a convex hull of the shadow curve and the
                object-hull of the geometry at the candidate orientation. The shadow curve is fixed as the top
                surface of the geometry, perpendicular to the candidate orientation, producing the overall cavity
                design for given orientation of the embedded geometry. The volume of the cavity design, Vc is
                evaluated by applying the divergence theorem on cavity mesh.</p>
            <h3>Stage 2: Cavity Design Automation </h3>
            <p> While shadow projection rapidly generated cavity, it also forms additional gaps between cavity and
                embedded object. These gaps may result in an unstable assembly by allowing free movement of the
                embedded object that could cause print failure, or damage through friction within the cavity. An
                ideal embedding approach must be able to account for the volumetric gaps. This led to investigate a
                new methodology for cavity and shape convertor called voxel simulation.</p>

            <img src="./blogs/embed-am/voxel-bool.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <p>This approach comprises two steps: defining both the part and the object spaces and then performing
                the Voxel Boolean simulation. The first step is to generate the two different virtual spaces: the
                object space and the part space. In the current implementation, the object space is a cuboidal voxel
                volume of twice the height of the embedded object in its optimum orientation. The voxelized object
                is then placed in the top half of the object space, while the bottom half is left with no material
                (Step 1). Conversely, the same resolution as the object space is used for the part space, but the
                bottom half is filled with material. Once both spaces have been generated, the second step is to
                simulate the embedding process. For embedding, the object in the object space is moved downward one
                voxel step at a time: a Boolean operation between object space and part space is carried out for
                each voxel step (Step 2). The resulting part space is simultaneously updated. This process is
                repeated until the object reaches the bottom of the object space. To identify the final embedding
                cavity, the material in the part space is inverted and saved as a separate STL file. This cavity is
                then used in a Boolean operation with the original AM part.</p>
            <img src="./blogs/embed-am/voxel-sim.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <h3>Stage 3: Shape Convertor Automation </h3>
            <p>To automate the shape convertor design, a scenario of moving the embedding object into the cavity
                geometry from bottom to top in a straight line is simulated. Like the previous part space, a cavity
                space is created with double the height of the cavity geometry, with its top half filled with the
                identified cavity geometry from Stage 2 and the bottom half is filled with no material. In contrast
                to the previous approach, the object space is created with the embedded object in the bottom half of
                the space, with no material in the top half. To simulate the creation of the shape converter, the
                embedded object moves upward in the space by one voxel at a time. Like the previously shown
                simulation, a Boolean subtractive operation is carried out where the object space is removed from
                the cavity space until the object reaches the top of the object space, resulting in the final shape
                converter design.</p>
