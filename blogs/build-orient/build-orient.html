                The layered fabrication approach in Additive Manufacturing (AM), specifically Fused Deposition Modeling
                (FDM), induces directional anisotropy, affecting mechanical strength. This study presents a machine
                learning-based optimization framework to determine the optimal build orientation for FDM parts,
                maximizing the minimum Factor of Safety (FoS) under given loading conditions. The methodology employs an
                Artificial Neural Network (ANN) coupled with a Bayesian optimization algorithm to streamline the
                process. The framework was validated through computational experiments on multiple test components,
                demonstrating significant improvements in mechanical strength and reliability.

                <p>
                    Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables the creation of complex geometries with customizable material
                    properties, revolutionizing fields such as design and manufacturing. However, the layered nature of
                    FDM introduces anisotropy, which significantly affects the mechanical performance of printed parts.
                    This research addresses these challenges by proposing a build orientation optimization framework
                    that leverages machine learning to enhance structural strength. The algorithm optimizes the
                    orientation to maximize the minimum Factor of Safety (FoS) under specified loading conditions,
                    ensuring even stress distribution and improved mechanical integrity.

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>
                    The proposed optimization framework consists of four primary stages: Physical Experiments, Virtual
                    Simulation, Machine Learning, and Optimization. The process begins with characterizing the material
                    properties through physical experiments, which are then used to calibrate a Finite Element Model
                    (FEM) for virtual simulations. Machine learning, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), is
                    employed to approximate the complex relationships observed in the data, allowing for faster
                    optimization using Bayesian algorithms.

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>
                    The optimization framework was tested on various components, including standard tensile samples and
                    complex geometries such as a wheel hub and door handle. In each scenario, the optimized build
                    orientation led to significant improvements in mechanical strength, with tensile strength increasing
                    by up to 126% in some cases. The computational model accurately predicted the optimal orientations,
                    aligning the strongest build layers with the loading paths, thus enhancing the overall performance
                    of the parts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The framework's efficacy was validated through both computational simulations and physical testing.
                    Components fabricated using the optimal orientations showed markedly improved structural integrity
                    compared to those printed in default orientations. This confirms the practical applicability of the
                    proposed machine learning-driven optimization approach.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning-based optimization in enhancing the
                    mechanical performance of FDM components by optimizing build orientation. The integrated approach
                    combining physical experiments, FEM simulations, and machine learning provides a robust tool for
                    determining optimal build orientations, which significantly improves structural strength. Future
                    research could extend this methodology to multi-objective optimization, addressing additional
                    factors such as surface quality, support structure minimization, and manufacturing time reduction to
                    broaden the frameworkâ€™s applicability in real-world manufacturing environments.
