            <p> In this research, we collected eye-tracking data from nine engineering graduate students as they
                redesigned a traditionally manufactured part for Additive Manufacturing. Final artifacts were assessed
                for manufacturability and quality of final design, and design behaviors were captured via the
                eye-tracking data. Statistical analysis of design behavior duration shows that participants with more
                than three years of industry experience spend significantly less time removing material and revising
                than those with less experience. Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) analysis of the design behaviors gives
                insight to the transitions between behaviors through which designers proceed. Findings show that high
                performing designers proceeded through four behavioral states, smoothly transitioning between states. In
                contrast, low-performing designers roughly transitioned between states, with moderate transition
                probabilities back and forth between multiple states.​

                <h2>Data Collection</h2>

                <p> ​We recruited participants with a design for additive manufacturing background. The challenge given
                    to the participants was to re-design an airplane bearing bracket from ALCOA Corporation for AM,
                    based on the prompt developed as part of an open crowdsource competition by GrabCAD. The design
                    prompt asked participants to minimize mass and optimize for weight and strength while satisfying
                    loading constraints and metal L-PBF manufacturing considerations.. Data collection was conducted in
                    person on the research team’s data computers equipped with SolidWorks, Autodesk Fusion 360, and
                    eye-tracking data collection capabilities. </p>

                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p>​Video activities including of eye-tracking data for all participants were analyzed using the
                    constant comparative method to develop a codebook for observational analysis using a combination of
                    a priori and emergent coding methods. We describe “direct” design behaviors as those that directly
                    affect the design (e.g., sketching or editing the artifact) and “indirect” design behaviors as those
                    that represent the environment of the designer (e.g., conducting stress analysis). The design
                    efficacy of each artifact was evaluated based on the final CAD files to quantify design quality
                    based on the primary criteria of weight, build time estimate, support volume, total volume, and
                    strength indicated with factor of safety. Then the participants were categorized into low-performing
                    and high-performing designers, based on design efficacy score. Last, to understand the dynamics of
                    designers’ behaviors, we employed Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM), a machine learning approach that
                    elicits underlying relationships between patterns of occurrences that are not easily observable. HMM
                    can be used to describe stochastic processes, in which a system transitions states that cannot be
                    directly observed.</p>
