            <p>With the advent in Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies and Computational Sciences, design
                algorithms such as Topology Optimization (TO) have garnered the interest of academia and industry. TO
                aims to generate optimum structures by maximizing the stiffness of the structure, given a set of
                geometric, loading and boundary conditions. However, these approaches are computationally expensive as
                it requires many iterations to converge to an optimum solution. The purpose of this work is to explore
                the effectiveness of deep generative models on a diverse range of topology optimization problems with
                varying design constraints, loading and boundary conditions. Specifically, four distinctive models were
                successfully developed, trained, and evaluated to generate rapid designs with comparable results to that
                of conventional algorithms. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the novel design problem
                representation and proposed generative models in rapid topology optimization.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The work investigates an additively manufactured Michell beam as a use case for the proposed deep
                    learning framework. We implemented the SIMP model. topology optimization to generate a training
                    dataset.
                    We generated 60,000 data points considering different boundary (BC) and loading conditions (LC),
                    geometric constraints, and volume fraction (VF). In addition to variety in boundary and loading
                    conditions in the dataset, we also considered the presence of active and passive elements. Volume
                    fraction, an important hyper-parameter and design decision is also being considered as a varying
                    parameter. However, other hyper-parameters such as filter radius and penalty factor were kept
                    constant
                    as
                    per best heuristics followed in practice (filter radius = 2, penalty factor p = 3). </p>

                <p> The images were created at both low and high resolution. The five images represent different aspects
                    of
                    the problem: volume fraction with available design space, loading and boundary conditions in X and Y
                    directions, as shown in Figure 2 with a sample TO problem. This type of input dataset will ensure
                    the
                    generalizability and quality of the data for training with varying design space and loading and
                    boundary
                    conditions, as validated previously in [3]. We represent design space and volume fraction using a
                    single
                    image, thereby reducing computational time. We define volume fraction to be the inverse of the pixel
                    intensity of the design space image. A black pixel (with intensity = 0) represents a 100% dense
                    volume
                    fraction, while a white pixel (with intensity = 255) represents a 0% volume fraction. The active and
                    passive elements are represented as black and white pixels respectively in the same image as the
                    volume
                    fraction.</p>

                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p>We explored four different generative models to achieve a high quality rapid design agent. Out of
                    this four, TOP-GAN, a variant of pix2pix out-perform others in terms of quality and performance.
                    More details can be found in the report.</p>

                <p>Though TOP-GAN is powerful enough to rapidly generate high quality solutions, it is unable to
                    generate fine structures. Additionally, the model outputs only one solution whereas in real-life,
                    multiple solutions are possible. To advance the TOP-GAN and solve these problems, we introduce deep
                    learning based model. This model excel at both generating at higher resolution and ability to
                    produce multiple solutions. This is achieved using advance techniques found in literature - MSG-GAN,
                    Spade normalization and multi-modal input.  The details of the model and results will be uploaded
                    soon after the journal paper is published..</p>
